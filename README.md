Optimisation Techniques
========

The purpose of this repo is to represent a few optimisation techniques which began as a University project. For the most part, the single file which currently exists is a direct part of that project but they will be expanded upon.

### Usage

Though this repo is not necesaarily of any practical use, it may want to be compiled by whoever. Steps are simple as they stand, `git clone` and compile...

    git clone https://github.com/BodneyC/optimisation-techniques.git
    g++ -c Chrono.cc techniques.cc && g++ -o techniques techniques.o Chrono.o
    ./techniques

It really doesn't do much as is and doesn't work 100% atm â†“      

### Additional Info

This is coming from a Windows platform (VS project) and so does not immediately compile for Linux, it will when I can be bothered to make it so.
